🚀 Project Title: Wscube Figma Layout → Responsive Website

I took a Wscube Figma layout and brought it to life as a fully functional, responsive website — blending ⚛️ React.js for a modern, component-based structure and 🎨 Bootstrap for sleek, mobile-first styling.

This project wasn’t just about coding — it was about translating a design vision into an interactive, accessible, and high-performing website that works seamlessly across devices.


💡 What I Did:

✨ Design-to-Code Conversion – Transformed static Figma mockups into dynamic, reusable React components while preserving the visual essence.

📱 Full Responsiveness – Leveraged Bootstrap’s grid system to ensure flawless adaptability on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

🎯 Pixel-Perfect Precision – Matched every detail of the original design, from spacing and typography to color schemes and component alignment.

⚡ Performance & Scalability – Organized code for easy maintenance, fast loading, and future feature expansion.

🎨 Modern UI/UX Practices – Followed best practices to deliver an engaging and intuitive user experience.

This project showcases my ability to convert design files into reality, my proficiency with React.js & Bootstrap, and my eye for detail when it comes to UI/UX.
